  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
      As an aspiring software engineer, I am deeply passionate about solving complex problems through technology. With each project, I strive to create meaningful and impactful software. My journey in programming is driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning in various languages and frameworks.

      Outside of coding, I enjoy creative hobbies like playing the guitar, painting, and reading. These activities offer a refreshing balance to my technical pursuits, helping me to bring new perspectives to my work.
